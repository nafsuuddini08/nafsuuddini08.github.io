BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser, It allows hooking the browser of the victim machine, allowing attackers to carry out social engineering attacks, scan the victim's network, see the traffic of the victim's browser and allows the use of tools such as metasploit. What it's does this framwork is to snip up a fake website with embedded malicious code and all we need to do is send the url that generate this framework and send it to the victim, and once the victim click that url it will execute a malicious js file called "hook.js" and it will hooked the browser of the victim. 

## How works?

Firt to understand beef we need to know some few concepts:

API:

Rest API:

Restfull API:

Hooking attack:

Man-in-the-browser attack:

What i mention before beef uses a javascript file called ***hook.js*** that will hook one or more browsers and will use them for launching directed command modiles and further attacks against the system though a opem door: the we browser context, beef use a web interface to manega and sedn commands (attacks) to the browser zombies.

Features:

Beef has a page list with 128 exploits that we can use on the victim machine, beef is a modular framework means that it can be easily extended with custom browser exploitation commands, it provides restful api that allows to control beef throuth HTTP request in json format and beef it can be configured to be integrated with metasploit.

## Configuration

In kali linux and i think in parrot this tool comes by default, but if you don't have install it you can use the following command:

```
apt install beef-xss -y
```

***note***: In some distros it may be that you can't install it with the apt packege manager, you will need to install it manually cloning the [repo](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/Installation).
