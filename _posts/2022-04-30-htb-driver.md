# Scanning

We are going to perform nmap scanning to discover ports and other relevant information to the target machine, for this we are going to use the following parameters or flags:

|Flags|Description |  
|-----|----------- |
|-p-  |Means that we want to scan all the ports that exists in tcp and udp which is in total 65,535 ports.|
|-sS  |Means that we want tcp syn scan.           |
|--min-rate 5000 | Means we just want to send packets no slower then 5000 packets per second to discover ports, and with that parameter our scan will be most faster. |
|--open | Means that we want only output the ports with the status open not filtred.
|-vvv | Means that we want to output more information.
|-n | Means we don't want DNS resolution, because sometimes the DNS resolution can take our scan much slower.
|-Pn | Means that we don't to ping to discover ports.
|-oG | Means that we want to save the scan in grapable format to not rescan again, you have more formats to save like nmap, xml, etc.

The ***extractPorts*** script:

```bash
extractPorts () {
        ports="$(cat $1 | grep -oP '\d{1,5}/open' | awk '{print $1}' FS='/' | xargs | tr ' ' ',')"
        ip_address="$(cat $1 | grep -oP '\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}' | sort -u | head -n 1)"
        echo -e "\n[*] Extracting information...\n" > extractPorts.tmp
        echo -e "\t[*] IP Address: $ip_address" >> extractPorts.tmp
        echo -e "\t[*] Open ports: $ports\n" >> extractPorts.tmp
        echo $ports | tr -d '\n' | xclip -sel clip
        echo -e "[*] Ports copied to clipboard\n" >> extractPorts.tmp
        cat extractPorts.tmp
        rm extractPorts.tmp
}
```

## Scanning - Ports Recognition

Once we have discovered possible ports, we will perform another scan to recognize the services and versions that use each of these ports. To order to do that we going to use the following parameters or flags:

|Flags|Description |  
|-----|------------|
|-sCV |Means that we want to use some nmap scripts, in this case to discover the version and services that are running each of those ports. 
|-p   |To specify the ports.           |
|-oN  |Save the scan in nmap format. 

Remember that nmap have bunch of scripts that we can use, nmap scripts end in ***.nse*** extension (nmap script engine).

Remember that nmap scripts have many categories that we can search for.
