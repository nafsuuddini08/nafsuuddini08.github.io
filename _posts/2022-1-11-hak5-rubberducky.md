Rubber ducky by hak5 is a usb that simulates a keyboard that as soon as it is connected to a computer starts to write or perform the payload that we have indicated in a super fast way, in this article we will perform some payloads and attacks that we can perform and how to mitigate these types of attacks.

Here we can see the parts that make up the rubber ducky and the tools we need that are already included in the package we bought, which in this case is the micro-SD card, sd to usb adapter (to put our payloads on the micro-sd card to our pc) and the usb to mini usb adapter if we want to connect the rubber ducky to an andriod phone or tablet.

Now what we need is an encoder for our rubber ducky payloads, in my case I'm going to use the shell to encode my payloads which you can download from my [repo](https://github.com/nafsuuddini08/USB-Rubber-Ducky), but there are websites that allow us to do this like [Ducktoolkit](https://ducktoolkit.com/encode).

In the hak5 repo we have a lot of payloads that we can use, but in this case we are going to make our own payloads.
